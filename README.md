This is a telegram bot that monitors your wallet balance and informs you with any deposit/withdraw done

it has been created to be notify you once the payout of your master nodes is done

currently it supports Eternity and Arctic coins, becasue I've masternodes in those coins, but I'll add more coins later,

2- press start then /add_address

3- Select Wallet Type

4- Enter Address Label (any label you want)

5- Enter wallet public address
be sure to add the correct address as till now the bot doesn't allow modifying the address after adding it

6- Bot will monitor the address' balance and will notify you once payout or withdraw done to this address.

Note:
